# rust-discord-bot
This is just a mess around bot for me and some friends. This is not meant to be anything serious.

Env arguments

This is entirely just a implementation to automate with a bot for https://github.com/liamcottle/rustplus.js

SERVER_IP = Server IP (or hostname)  
SERVER_IP = Server App Port  
SERVER_IP = Your Steam ID  
SERVER_IP = Player Token (Token from [Server Pairing](#pairing))

##Pairing
You can follow the info [here](https://github.com/liamcottle/rustplus.js/blob/master/README.md#using-the-cli-pair-tool)
though as long as you have the modules installed you can use

```
git clone https://github.com/liamcottle/rustplus.js
cd rustplus.js
npm install
node pair.js
```
